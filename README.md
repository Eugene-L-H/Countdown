# Countdown
Webapp that produces a real-time countdown of seconds, minutes, hours and days for each
event registered by the user.

# Description
A web page displaying a form with 3 fields. Asks the user to enter the name,
date and time of an event that they are looking forward to. Once entered a
countdown for that event will be displayed on the page.

# Instructions
The user will enter an event name up to 24 characters long in the top input of
the form.

Next they will select a date using the date selector in the middle input. Last
they will select a time using the time selector in the final input.

- A maximum of 10 events can be registered.
- This app is NOT developed for mobile devices.

# Installation/Run
Countdown can be run from https://eugene-l-h.github.io/Countdown/ or by
downloading the files and opening the index.html file in the browser of your
choice. 

This project was developed and tested in Google Chrome on screen resolutions of
1920x1080 and 1366x768. 

# Notes
This was the first project where I used JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. I had a
lot of fun learning how to manipulate HTML values/content and to add and
subtract HTML elements from the page.

I wish I had developed Countdown from a mobile-first approach. The global scope
is also a little polluted.

This project taught me that much of writing JavaScript as a web developer has to do
with creating, deleting and manipulating HTML/CSS values.
